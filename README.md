# Shopify-Overview - Protein-Works

## Executive Summary
The dashboard provides a high-level overview of revenue, profitability, customer behaviour, and marketing efficiency, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify growth drivers and optimisation opportunities.

Tools Used: SQL, Python, Tableau

Data Sources: Data model based on Shopify, Google Analytics 4, Facebook Ads, Instagram & TikTok Analytics schemas. All data is synthetic.

## Business Problem
Expense management platforms face several challenges:
- Understanding Expansion & Contraction Drivers
- Predicting Churn Before Revenue Loss
- Forecasting Revenue Accurately
  
## Methodology
### Data Source
Python was used to generate two datasets:
-	Accounts (customer profile, signup, churn, industry, seats)
-	Subscriptions (monthly MRR per account)
The model simulates 3 years of realistic behaviour based on patterns observed in real expense platforms (e.g., Ramp, Brex):

#### Assumptions Built Into the Data Generation include:
-	Churn Probability
-	Expansion Behaviour
-	Contraction Events & Plan upgrades

### SQL Analysis
**Generated SQL queries to calculate:**
- MRR Movements - Using LAG() to compare monthly MRR per account:
  - New, Expansion, Contraction & Churn MRR
- Quarterly Cohort Table - Cohorts grouped by signup quarter with:
  - Retained flags
  - Quarter-by-quarter activity
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Churn Rate
- Expansion MRR %

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced SQL (CTEs, window functions, views, constraints, indexing)
- Python (data generation with realistic assumptions)
- Tableau (dashboard design, KPIs, multi-chart layouts)
- SaaS metric interpretation (NRR, churn, expansion, cohorts)

## Key Insights & Recommendations
### Insight 1 – MRR Growth Is Driven More by Expansion Than New Sales
- Across most months, Expansion MRR > New MRR.
- Existing customers are increasing seats or upgrading plans.
- Customer Success and product experience are strong expansion drivers.
### Recommendation – Double down on expansion motions
- Identify features correlated with expansion (e.g., corporate cards, reimbursement workflows (Uber & Deliveroo)).
- Implement “adoption nudges” for companies with <60% seat activation.
### Insight 2 – Significant Drop in Retention after the first year
- Strong onboarding but weak customer loyalty
- Competitors may be pulling customers away
### Recommendation – Differentiate products and track customers 
- Expand offering (audit automation or AI receipt extraction)
- Improve UX — expense tools with poor UX churn the fastest
- Create engagement triggers for low-activity or recently contracted accounts

## Next Steps
Strategic Enhancements
- Add **Customer Acquisition Cost** (CAC) data and calculate **LTV/CAC**
- Compare retention across industries to heighten focus
- Design A/B test for new product offering
